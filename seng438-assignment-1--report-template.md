# Introduction

Prior to this first assignment, most of us had little to no experience in doing either exploratory testing or manual functional test. We only had the theoretical knowledge needed to perform these types of tests which was obtained through the course lectures and course material. We began our lab work by first getting familiar with the ATM software to be tested. Next, our team set up Backlog to be used as the defect tracking system to report bugs. We then moved on to the exploratory testing phase, logging any defects we note in Backlog. We had prepared by reading through the functional requirements of the system and then devising a test plan to be used. After the exploratory phase, we moved on to the manual scripted testing and went through all of the test cases provided, reporting all defects. Lastly, we conducted regression testing on version 1.1 of the system by first going through previous defects found and seeing if they had been fixed in the updated system. We then went through the rest of the test cases and reported any new defects that we found. 

Working on this assignment, we were able to actually experience these types of tests and we were able to gain more knowledge regarding these 2 types of tests on software. It was a very valuable experience specially working in groups on this and details about how the assignment went and how the team decided to work on it will be discussed in this report

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

There are many differences between these two methods of testing. 
Exploratory testing is mostly like experiencing the application without any knowledge of it. This will make the process very personal and the quality of testing is going to be dependent on the tester. But this can be an advantage for this type of testing. By exploring the product based on the tester’s experience, they may find issues that were not considered in any of the scripted tests. For the disadvantages of exploratory testing, we can mention two things. First of all, there is no documentation as a reference for this type of testing, and second of all, critical issues of the product can be easily missed.

Though exploratory testing was much faster at finding issues, the use of a script helped us find bugs in 1.1 in places there were no bugs in 1.0

Manual functional testing is contains documented step-by-step test cases. Any tester can run these test cases on the product and check the correctness of the results. So, in contrast with the last method, having experienced testers does not help find more issues. Also, the speed of finding bugs is lower due to the number of test cases that the tester should run. But, it has a lot of advantages. Having standard documentation can help repeat the test scenarios which is practical for regression testing. Also, the producers of the application can create test cases for their expectations.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Here’s notes and discussion of peer reviews based on experience of Carl and Mohammadreza

> “I was somewhat confused about what was required for the defect reports, when I saw one of my peers I saw how to format it in a clear and effective way and then emulated that method going forward for my reports.“ - Carl

> “Peer review helped us not create duplicate issues. In one situation, after we talked about some bugs in the same functionality, we found out that there is a single bug represented in different ways.” - Mohammadreza

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

We had a team of four so Mohammed and Bhavdeep became a pair and Carl and Mohammadreza formed another pair. Our team met up over a Zoom meeting, and decided the pairs we were going to use for the testing. We split up into separate break-out rooms and began. In each pair, the functionalities are separated between pair members. Also, we had discussions on the issues each of the members found.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

* Due to teams being assigned on the weekend the team only met up during the week the assignment was due. The biggest trouble was scheduling issues with the group. 

* Fortunately, there weren’t many challenges that we faced as a group when working on this assignment. The process was mostly very smooth with just a few misunderstandings along the way that we’re quickly resolved. Working on this lab assignment, we as a team was able to learn many lessons and gain a lot of experience not just in testing software but also in working with a team of people that we didn’t know prior to working on this lab. Being able to communicate and work efficiently with a new group of people is an essential asset that I believe every software engineer/developer should have and this lab definitely helped us as a group develop our communication skills more. In regards to tests, most group members had no experience in doing any scripted testing so that was also very valuable for us to experience for the first time.


# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The document was well structured, thorough, and quite useful. We didn’t have difficulties in figuring out what we needed to do. Possibly overly thorough, it was very long and we think some sections could have been removed or shortened, like the section of Pair Testing could have been part of another section. There were also minor issues with formatting that made it harder to read such as the Lab Report Marking Scheme having been broken up incorrectly. Finally, throughout the document, it referred to an appendix, but the appendix was not properly labeled so it took some time for me to realize where the info was.
